## Final Project: Expense Tracker

A command-line expense tracker built in Python that helps users record, view, delete, and export their expenses. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, input validation, and basic user authentication.

### Features

- Object-oriented design for expense management.
- Top-level wrapper functions to meet CS50P function requirements.
- User login system with credentials stored in `config.json`.
- Add expenses with date, category, amount, and note.
- View all recorded expenses in a table format.
- Delete expenses by index.
- Export expenses to a PDF report.
- Input validation for date, category, and amount.
- Handles program interruption gracefully (Ctrl+C / EOF).

### Dependencies

- tabulate>=0.9.0 – for displaying expenses in a table format
- fpdf>=2.5.5 – for exporting expenses to PDF
